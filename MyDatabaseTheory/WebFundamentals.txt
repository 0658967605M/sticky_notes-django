WebFundamentals 

1. What is Web 3.0, and how is it different from Web 1.0 and Web 2.0? 

-Web 3.0 is the next generation of the internet, designed to give users 
 more control, ownership, and privacy over their data and online activities.
-Web 1.0 “Read” (Information),Web 2.0 “Read and Write” (Interaction),
 Web 3.0 “Read, Write, and Own” (Decentralization and Control).

2. What are the functional differences between the front end of a web 
application and its back end? 

-Front End → What users see and interact with
-Back End → What happens behind the scenes (logic, data, and server operations)

3.In your own words, explain the process that takes place from when 
you type a URL into the address bar in your browser until you finally 
view the page you have requested. Include the HTTP 
request–response cycle in your answer and provide an example of the 
HTTP request and response messages.

3.1 You Type the URL

-You enter a web address (for example, https://www.example.com) into
 the browser’s address bar and hit Enter.

The browser’s goal:
-Find the server that hosts the website
-Request the page you want
-Display it to you

3.2 DNS Lookup (Finding the Server)

-The browser doesn’t understand domain names (like example.com) — it needs 
 an IP address (like 93.184.216.34) to locate the server.
-So it asks a DNS (Domain Name System) server to translate the domain name into its IP address.

Result:
www.example.com → 93.184.216.34

3.3 Browser Establishes a Connection

-Once it has the IP address:
-The browser connects to the web server using the TCP/IP protocol.
-If the site uses HTTPS, a TLS/SSL handshake happens first to 
 establish a secure, encrypted connection.

3.4 The HTTP Request (Client → Server)

-The browser now sends a message to the web server asking for a 
 specific resource (e.g., a web page, image, or file).
-This message is the HTTP request.

-Example of an HTTP Request
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)
Accept: text/html
Connection: keep-alive


Explanation:

GET → the method (asking to retrieve something)

/index.html → the page being requested
Host: → the domain name
User-Agent: → identifies your browser
Accept: → tells the server what formats you can handle (like HTML)

3.5 The Web Server Processes the Request

-The server receives the request and checks what’s being asked for.
-If it’s a static page (like an HTML file), it retrieves it directly.
-If it’s dynamic (like a PHP, Python, or Node.js app), the server runs 
 backend code, maybe queries a database, and then generates the page content.

3.6 The HTTP Response (Server → Client)
-Once the server has the requested data, it sends it back to the browser in 
 an HTTP response message.

-Example of an HTTP Response
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sun, 10 Nov 2025 14:00:00 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 1256

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>Example Website</title></head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to Example.com!</h1>
<p>This is the home page.</p>
</body>
</html>


Explanation:

200 OK → means the request succeeded

Content-Type: → tells the browser it’s HTML content

The body contains the actual webpage data to display

3.7 Browser Renders the Page

-The browser receives the HTML and starts rendering the page.

 It may also request additional resources mentioned in the HTML, such as:

-CSS (for styling)
-JavaScript files (for interactivity)
-Images, videos, or fonts
-Each of those resources triggers additional HTTP requests and responses.

3.8 Page Displayed to the User

Finally, after assembling all those pieces, the browser displays the fully rendered webpage on your screen.
