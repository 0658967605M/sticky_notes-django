Relational Database

1. What is normalisation?

-Normalisation is a process of restructuring database tables to minimise redundancies 
and reduce data anomalies, ultimately bringing the database to a consistent state. 


2. When is a table in 1NF?

- when all of the key attributes are defined, there are no repeating groups
 in the table, and all attributes are dependent on the primary key.

  
3. When is a table in 2NF?

- when it is in 1NF and includes no partial dependencies,
no attribute is dependent on only a portion of the primary key.  

 
4. When is a table in 3NF?

-when it is in 2NF, and it contains no transitive dependencies.
