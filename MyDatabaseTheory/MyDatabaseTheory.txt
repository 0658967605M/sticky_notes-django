1. Explain the difference between data and information.

-Data is a raw, unprocessed facts, figures, or symbols that doesn't have 
 enough meaning behind.
-Information is data that is processed and given context to
 provide more meaning.

 
2. What is metadata? 

-A set of data that describes and gives information about other data
 such as units of measurement, the time period the data represents,
 or labels. 


3. What is a DBMS, and what are its advantages? 

-A database management system is a collection of programs
 that works to manage the database structure and control access 
 to the data stored in the database. 
-Advantages of DBMS are: Better data access and security
                         Improved data integration 
                         Smooth data manipulation 
                         High quality information


4. Compare and contrast operational databases with analytical databases,
   and provide an example of each.

-Operational database are designed to store historical data and aggregated 
 data. (e.g. older processing , financial transactions etc.)
-Analytical database are designed for data analysis and business
 intelligence. (e.g. data warehouse, online analytical cubes etc.)

 
5. Explain the types of data and use cases where NoSQL databases are most 
   effective.

-Relational database are the most widely used database type. They structure
 data into tables, composed of rows and columns, with related information
 linked between them.
-Non Relational database  offer more flexible approach to data storage
 and management.


6. Which DBMS does not require server configuration, and what are the 
   advantages of using it?

-SQLite is lightweight, it doesn't require sever configuration. 
-Advantages of SQLite is that it offers reliability and speed, making
 it a popular choice for applications that require a straightforward,
 serverless database solution. 


7. Explain ACID properties in the context of a DBMS.

-Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability that guarantee the 
 reliability of database transactions, even in the event of system failures.
*Atomicity ensures a transaction is an all-or-nothing operation. 
*Consistency maintains the database's integrity by ensuring transactions move
 from one valid state to another. 
*Isolation ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.
*Durability guarantees that committed transactions are permanent and will not be lost.
