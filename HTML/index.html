    <h1>Hobbies</h1>

    <h2>Drawing</h2>
    <p>When I was a child, I loved spending hours drawing my favorite cartoon characters with my box of <strong>colorful pencils</strong>.</p>
    <p>One time, my teacher displayed one of my drawings on the classroom wall — I felt <em>so proud</em>!</p>

    <h2>Playing Soccer</h2>
    <p>Every weekend, I would go play <strong>ball</strong> around the neighborhood with my friends.</p>
    <p>I remember falling once and getting a scraped knee, I couldnt go back and play till today — I was <em>determined</em> to keep going but could'nt!</p>

    <h1>Toys</h1>

    <h2>Lego Sets</h2>
    <p>I spent countless afternoons building <strong>castles and spaceships</strong> out of Lego bricks.</p>
    <p>My favorite part was when my dad joined me to create the biggest Lego tower we’d ever made — it almost reached the table lamp!</p>

    <h2>PlayStation</h2>
    <p>I used to play a game , named <em>Kill Zone</em>, went everywhere with it — even to family trips.</p>
    <p>I used to love playing the game cause I was curious; it had interesting stages like <strong>Zombie Land</strong>.</p>
